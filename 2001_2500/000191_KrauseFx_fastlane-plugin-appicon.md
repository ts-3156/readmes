![Demo image](demo.png)

## Getting Started

This project is a [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-appicon`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin appicon
```

Please note that this plugin uses the GraphicsMagick library. If you do not have it, you can install it via Homebrew:

```
brew install graphicsmagick
```

## About appicon

Generate required icon sizes and iconset from a master application icon.

Since many apps use a single 1024x1024 icon to produce all the required sizes from, why not automate the process and save lots of time?

## Example

Check out the [example `Fastfile`](fastlane/Fastfile) to see how to use this plugin. Try it by cloning the repo, running `fastlane install_plugins` and `bundle exec fastlane test`.

Just specify the source image using the `appicon_image_file`. Optionally specify the devices using `appicon_devices` and the destination path using `appicon_path`.

We recommend storing the full-size picture at `fastlane/metadata/app_icon.png` so it can be picked up by _deliver_, as well as this plugin

```ruby
lane :basic do
  appicon(
    appicon_devices: [:ipad, :iphone, :ios_marketing],
    appicon_path: "MajorKey/Assets.xcassets"
  )
end

lane :test1 do
  appicon(appicon_image_file: 'spec/fixtures/Themoji.png',
             appicon_devices: [:ipad, :iphone, :ios_marketing])
end


lane :test2 do
  appicon(appicon_image_file: 'spec/fixtures/Themoji.png',
             appicon_devices: [:ipad, :iphone, :ios_marketing, :watch, :watch_marketing])
end

lane :test3 do
  # `appicon_image_file` defaults to "fastlane/metadata/app_icon.png"
  appicon(
    appicon_devices: [:iphone], 
    appicon_path: 'wwdcfamily/Images.xcassets' # output path
  )
end

# or

lane :android do
  android_appicon(
    appicon_image_file: 'spec/fixtures/Themoji.png',
    appicon_icon_types: [:launcher],
    appicon_path: 'app/res/mipmap'
  )
  android_appicon(
    appicon_image_file: 'spec/fixtures/ThemojiNotification.png',
    appicon_icon_types: [:notification],
    appicon_path: 'app/res/drawable',
    appicon_filename: 'ic_notification'
  )
end
```

## Run tests for this plugin
