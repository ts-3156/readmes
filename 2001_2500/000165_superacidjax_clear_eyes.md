# Clear Eyes

This makes is super easy to handle Retina images in your Rails 3.1+ apps. It adds r_image_tag that can be used in place of the existing image_tag and it'll automatically serve up Retina images to devices that can handle the resolution and normal images otherwise.

## How to Use it

In your Gemfile:

    gem 'clear_eyes'

In your application.js:

    //= require clear_eyes

## Usage
    = r_image_tag('my_awesome_image@2x.jpg')

This assumes that ```my_awesome_image@2x.jpg``` is sized properly for retina images. Remember, Retina images are double the pixel density of standard images.

Now that you have Retina-ready images and a way to serve them up in your views, what about non-retina machines?

There's a rake for that! You only need to create one image (the Retina one).

Running this: ```rake clear_eyes:convert``` will convert create non-retina images from the images in app/assets/images. It's even take care of the file names! Pretty cool right? So, ```my_awesome_image@2x.jpg``` will automatically be copied, downsized and named ```my_awesome_image.jpg```.

**NOTE** rmagick "~> 2.13.1" must be added to your Gemfile for this to work. It is not included by default in order to avoid adding rmagick to your production environment.
