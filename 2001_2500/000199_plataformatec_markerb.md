# Markerb

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/plataformatec/markerb.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/plataformatec/markerb)

**Markerb** allows you to render multipart e-mails from a single template. The template is written in Markdown, which is delivered as a text part, but also rendered and delivered as an HTML part.

The usage is quite simple. Assuming you have a notifier as below:

```ruby
class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
  def contact(recipient)
    @recipient = recipient
    mail(:to => @recipient, :from => "john.doe@example.com") do |format|
      format.text
      format.html
    end
  end
end
```

If you create a template at `app/views/notifier/contact.markerb`:

```erb
Multipart templates **rocks**, right <%= @recipient %>?!
```

It will generate two parts, one in text and another in html when delivered. Before we finish, here are a few things you might need to know:

* The `contact.markerb` template should not have a format in its name. Adding a format would make it unavailable to be rendered in different formats;

* The order of the parts matter. It is important for e-mail clients that you call `format.text` before you call `format.html`;

* Notice you can normally use ERb inside the template.

Enjoy!
