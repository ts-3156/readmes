## Features

* configurable to rank different types of words different (uppercase, long words, etc.)
* rate based on amount (%) of vowels and consonants in a string
* directly get keywords from String objects
* blacklist words via a plain text file, String or an Array of words (per language if needed)
* optionally, configure a whitelist and only words from that list will get ranked
* uses word stemming if necessary (requires the `fast-stemmer` or `stemmer` gem)
* merge together Keywords from multiple sources
* contains a CLI tool that operates on STDIN/OUT and is configurable via parameters
* can use `bloomfilter-rb` gem for better performance (optional)
* words on the bonus list will receive a higher score

## Installation

* `[sudo] gem install highscore`

For better blacklist perfomance, use the `bloomfilter-rb` gem:

* `[sudo] gem install bloomfilter-rb`

To use word stemming, you need to have the `fast-stemmer` (C extension) or `stemmer` gem installed:

* `[sudo] gem install fast-stemmer`
* `[sudo] gem install stemmer`

## Examples

```ruby
text = Highscore::Content.new "foo bar"
text.configure do
  set :multiplier, 2
  set :upper_case, 3
  set :long_words, 2
  set :long_words_threshold, 15
  set :short_words_threshold, 3      # => default: 2
  set :bonus_multiplier, 2           # => default: 3
  set :vowels, 1                     # => default: 0 = not considered
  set :consonants, 5                 # => default: 0 = not considered
  set :ignore_case, true             # => default: false
  set :word_pattern, /[\w]+[^\s0-9]/ # => default: /\w+/
  set :stemming, true                # => default: false
end

# get only the top 50 keywords
text.keywords.top(50).each do |keyword|
  keyword.text   # => keyword text
  keyword.weight # => rank weight (float)
end

# you could also just use a string
keywords = "Foo bar baz".keywords(blacklist) do
  set :multiplier, 10
end
```

The result is either a Highscore::Keywords object or an Array (depending on whether it's sorted or not) that you
can iterate over. Each object in there is a Highscore::Keyword that has methods `text` and `weight`.

```ruby
keywords = "Foo bar is not bar baz".keywords(Highscore::Blacklist.load(['baz']))

keywords.rank.each do |k|
  puts "#{k.text} #{k.weight}"
end

# prints:
# Foo 3.0
# bar 2.0
# not 1.0
```

Have a look at `bin/highscore`, you can run highscore on your CLI and feed it with text on STDIN.

## Blacklisting and Whitelisting

### Using a custom blacklist to ignore keywords

```ruby
# setting single words
blacklist = Highscore::Blacklist.new
blacklist << 'foo'

# load a string/array
blacklist = Highscore::Blacklist.load "a string"
blacklist = Highscore::Blacklist.load %w{an array}

# loading from a file (separated by whitespace)
blacklist = Highscore::Blacklist.load_file "blacklist.txt"

# loading the default blacklist (falls back automatically if not explicit given)
blacklist = Highscore::Blacklist.load_default_file

# inject the blacklist into the content class
content = Highscore::Content.new "a string", blacklist
```

### Using a whitelist instead of ranking all words

```ruby
# construct and inject it just like a blacklist
whitelist = Highscore::Whitelist.load %w{these are valid keywords}
content = Highscore::Content.new "invalid words", whitelist
```

### Using bonus words

```ruby
# construct and inject it just like a blacklist
bonuslist = Highscore::Bonuslist.load %w{bonus words}
content = Highscore::Content.new "A string with bonus words in it", bonuslist
```

## I18n

```ruby
# Load a default blacklist
blacklist_default = Highscore::Blacklist.load "mister"
text = Highscore::Content.new "oui mister interesting", blacklist_default
text.keywords.top(3).join " "

# => prints "interesting oui"

# Load a rudimentary blacklist for French
blacklist_francais = Highscore::Blacklist.load "oui"
text.add_wordlist blacklist_francais, :french
text.keywords(:lang => :fr).top(3).join " "

# => prints "interesting mister"
```
