# Notable

:star2: Extraordinary insight into your users and background jobs

Wouldn’t it be great to see when one of your users encounters an error, timeout, or validation failure?  Now you can - directly in your admin pages.

#### Introducing Notable

Notable tracks notable requests and background jobs and stores them in your database.  What makes a request or job notable?  There are a number of default situations, but ultimately you decide what interests you.

By default, Notable tracks:

- errors
- 404s
- slow requests and jobs
- timeouts
- validation failures
- CSRF failures
- unpermitted parameters
- blocked and throttled requests

You can track custom notes as well.

## Installation

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'notable'
```

And run:

```sh
rails generate notable:requests
rails generate notable:jobs
rake db:migrate
```

For a web interface, check out [Notable Web](https://github.com/ankane/notable_web).

## Requests

A `Notable::Request` is created for:

- errors
- 404s
- slow requests
- timeouts
- validation failures
- [CSRF failures](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf)
- unpermitted parameters
- blocked and throttled requests

For timeouts, use [Slowpoke](https://github.com/ankane/slowpoke).

For blocked and throttled requests, use [Rack Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack).

## Jobs

Wouldn’t it be great to have a record of exact jobs that fail?

A `Notable::Job` is created for:

- errors
- slow jobs
- validation failures

## Manual Tracking

```ruby
Notable.track(note_type, note)
```

Like

```ruby
Notable.track("Auth Event", "Signed In")
```
