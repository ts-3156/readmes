[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/typus/typus/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/typus/typus/tree/master)

**Typus** is a control panel for [Ruby on Rails][rails] applications to
allow trusted users edit structured content.

It's not a CMS with a full working system but it provides a part of the
system: authentication, permissions and basic look and feel for your
websites control panel. So using [Rails][rails] with **Typus** lets you
concentrate on your application instead of the bits to manage the system.

**Typus** is the "old latin" word for **type** which stands for:

> A category of people or things having common characteristics.


## Key Features

- Built-in Authentication and Access Control Lists.
- CRUD and custom actions for your models on a clean interface.
- Customizable and extensible templates.
- Integrated [paperclip][paperclip] and [dragonfly][dragonfly] attachments viewer.
- Supports Rails 4
