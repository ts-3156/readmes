# Clipboard Ruby Gem [![version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/clipboard.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/clipboard) [<img src="https://travis-ci.org/janlelis/clipboard.svg" />](https://travis-ci.org/janlelis/clipboard)

Lets you access the clipboard from everywhere. Currently supported platforms:

- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- Cygwin (POSIX environment for Windows)
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Gtk+ (Cross Platform Widget Toolkit)
- Java (on JRuby)

## Usage

* `Clipboard.copy` - Copies a string to system clipboard
* `Clipboard.paste` - Paste contents from system clipboard as string
* `Clipboard.clear` - Empties the system clipboard

## Supported Rubies

* **2.6**, **2.5**, **2.4**, **2.3**

Unsupported, but might still work:

* **2.2**, **2.1**, **2.0**, **1.9**

## Setup

Add the following lines to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "clipboard"
gem "ffi", :platforms => [:mswin, :mingw] # Required by Clipboard on Windows
```

- **Important note for Linux** users: The clipboard requires the *xsel* or the *xclip* command-line program. On debian and ubuntu, *xsel* can be installed with: `sudo apt-get install xsel`

## Clipboard Implementations

In most environments, the appropriate clipboard implementation can be detected automatically. If none is found, the gem will fallback to a file based one, which will just write to/read from `~/.clipboard` instead of the system clipboard.

You can check the implementation used with: `Clipboard.implementation`

### Alternative Clipboard Providers

There are two implementations included in this gem, which are not used by default. You can opt-in to use them if you think they are a better fit for your application environment:

#### Java

Activate with: `Clipboard.implementation = Clipboard::Java`

This is an option for [JRuby users](https://www.jruby.org/) which will use the clipboard functionality from the Java standard library.

#### GTK+

Activate with: `Clipboard.implementation = Clipboard::Gtk`

This utilizes the **GTK+** library. See [Ruby-GNOME2](https://github.com/ruby-gnome2/ruby-gnome2#ruby-gnome2) for more info.

Requires the `gtk3` or `gtk2` gem to be installed.

## Tips & Tricks

### Linux: Using Clipboard via SSH

To be able to use the clipboard through SSH, you need to install `xauth` on your server and connect via `ssh -X` or `ssh -Y`. Please note that some server settings restrict this feature.

### Linux: Paste From Specific X11 Selection

The clipboard on Linux is divided into multiple clipboard selections. You can choose from which clipboard you want to `paste` from by
passing it as an argument. The default is *:clipboard*, other options are *:primary* and *:secondary*.

`Clipboard.copy` always copies to all three clipboards.

### Windows: Encoding Info

Windows uses [UTF-16LE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16) as its default encoding, so pasted strings will always come in UTF-16. You can then manually convert them to your desired encoding, for example, UTF-8, using the [String#encode](ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/String.html#method-i-encode) method:

```ruby
Clipboard.paste.encode('UTF-8')
```

### CLI Utility: blip

The [blip gem]((https://gist.github.com/janlelis/781835)) is a handy command-line wrapper for the clipboard gem. It lets you quickly copy file content to your clipboard:

```
$ blip FILE_NAME
```

Without any arguments, it will just paste the contents of the clipboard.
