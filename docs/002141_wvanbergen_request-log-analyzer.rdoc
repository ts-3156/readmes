= Request-log-analyzer {<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer.png" />}[http://travis-ci.org/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer]

This is a simple command line tool to analyze request log files in various formats to produce a performance report. Its purpose is to find what actions are best candidates for optimization.

* Analyzes log files. Currently supports: Amazon S3, Apache, Delayed::Job, Merb, Mysql, PostgreSQL, Rack, Rails and more.
* Combines multiple files and decompresses compressed files, which comes in handy if you are using logrotate.
* Uses several metrics, including cumulative request time, mean request time, process blockers, database and rendering time, HTTP methods and statuses, Rails action cache statistics, etc.) (Sample output: http://github.com/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer/wiki/sample-output)
* Runs on any  MRI 1.9+ compatible Ruby, has a low memory footprint and is reasonably fast, so it is safe to run on a production server.
