## Getting Started

The game is packed as a gem, so you can simply run:

    $ gem install space_invaders
    $ space-invaders

Or you can clone the repo and simply run the main file:

    $ git clone git@github.com:DamirSvrtan/space-invaders.rb.git
    $ ruby go.rb
    
## Troubles during installation:

 If you have problems installing the game, you're probably missing some OS specific libraries that Gosu uses. For further information checkout:
