# Spotify to MP3

A simple command line utility to download MP3 files of Spotify tracks. *Note those files are downloaded from Grooveshark, not from Spotify itself.*

---

**[Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/), the service this app was relying on, has shut down. Don't expect it to work anymore :(**

---

## Installation

### Mac OS X

```bash
$ sudo gem install spotify-to-mp3
```

Probably `sudo` can be ommited if using [rvm](http://beginrescueend.com/) or similar.

### Linux (Ubuntu)

Make sure you have rubygems installed and configured:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ruby2.0 ruby2.0-dev
$ echo 'PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.9/bin' | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/rubygems1.9.sh >/dev/null
```

```bash
$ sudo gem2.0 install spotify-to-mp3
```

## Usage

1. Create a file (like `songs.txt`) and copy the Spotify songs URLs to it. Plain song names are also
   accepted. It will look like this:

   ```
   http://open.spotify.com/track/1JqTcOjOn7gEpeC0JcRVPa
   spotify:track:1fE3ddAlmjJ99IIfLgZjTy
   The Drums - Money
   ```

2. Download songs. They are saved to the current directory. Errors will appear in red (like when a song is not found).

   ```bash
   $ spotify-to-mp3 songs.txt
   ```

Also, as it's common in Unix programs, you can pipe in the songs:

```bash
$ echo white knuckle ride | spotify-to-mp3
```

or simply:

```bash
$ spotify-to-mp3
```

and drag the songs from the Spotify app to the terminal.

## TODO

- Consider multiple artists songs

- Exit with a single Ctrl+C
- Cleaner output
- Don't pick remixes
