## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'jekyll-compose', group: [:jekyll_plugins]

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

After you have installed (see above), run `bundle exec jekyll help` and you should see:

Listed in help you will see new commands available to you:

```sh
  draft      # Creates a new draft post with the given NAME
  post       # Creates a new post with the given NAME
  publish    # Moves a draft into the _posts directory and sets the date
  unpublish  # Moves a post back into the _drafts directory
  page       # Creates a new page with the given NAME
```

Create your new page using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll page "My New Page"

Create your new post using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll post "My New Post"

Create your new draft using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll draft "My new draft"

Publish your draft using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll publish _drafts/my-new-draft.md
    # or specify a specific date on which to publish it
    $ bundle exec jekyll publish _drafts/my-new-draft.md --date 2014-01-24

Unpublish your post using:

    $ bundle exec jekyll unpublish _posts/2014-01-24-my-new-draft.md

## Configuration

To customize the default plugin configuration edit the `jekyll_compose` section within your jekyll config file.

### auto-open new drafts or posts in your editor

```yaml
  jekyll_compose:
    auto_open: true
```

and make sure that you have `EDITOR` or `JEKYLL_EDITOR` environment variable set.
For instance if you wish to open newly created Jekyll posts and drafts in Atom editor you can add the following line in your shell configuration:
```
export JEKYLL_EDITOR=atom
```

The latter one will override default `EDITOR` value.

### Set default front matter for drafts and posts

If you wish to add default front matter to newly created posts or drafts, you can specify as many as you want under `draft_default_front_matter` and `post_default_front_matter`config keys, for instance:

```yaml
  jekyll_compose:
  draft_default_front_matter:
    description:
    image:
    category:
    tags:
  post_default_front_matter:
    description:
    image:
    category:
    tags:
    published: false
    sitemap: false
```
