# Jobless
Jobless is a simple DSL written in Ruby for generating CVs.
It generates HTML files, which can be easily converted to PDF format if needed.
Here's an example of Jobless code.

```ruby
Jobless.cv do
  name "John Doe"
  email "john.doe@gmail.com"

  employment do
    entry do
      title "Full-stack Rails developer"
      company "Royal Programming Squad"
      start_date "April 2015"
      end_date "June 2015"
    end
    entry do
      title "C# Developer"
      company "Microsoft"
      start_date "January 2015"
      end_date "April 2015"
    end
  end
end
```
