# MotionBundler [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/archan937/motion-bundler.png)](http://travis-ci.org/archan937/motion-bundler)

Use Ruby gems and mock require statements within RubyMotion applications

## Introduction

[RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com) has united two great programming communities: the Ruby and iOS community. We are no longer forced to develop native iOS applications (for iPhone and iPad) using Objective-C and XCode anymore because we can choose using Ruby with any kind of text editor. Ruby gives us a lot of benefits like the beauty and flexibility of the language. Also, the Ruby community is driven by its enormous amount of open source libraries which are packed as so called "Ruby gems". Bundler is the Ruby standard for managing all the gem dependencies used within a Ruby project.

There are limitations though as you cannot use any random Ruby gem you want to. It either has to be RubyMotion aware (like [BubbleWrap](https://github.com/rubymotion/BubbleWrap)) or RubyMotion compatible (mostly when having as minimal gem dependencies as possible and not doing fancy Ruby stuff like code evaluation). Also, you cannot just require Ruby sources at runtime. You will have to specify them along with their mutual dependencies.

This can give us a lot of headaches and so I have created a Ruby gem called `MotionBundler`. It will unobtrusively track and specify the required Ruby sources and their mutual dependencies of Ruby gems you want to use in your RubyMotion application.

## Usage

### Set up your Gemfile and Rakefile

You need to setup your `Gemfile` by separating RubyMotion aware Ruby gems from the ones that are not. Put the RubyMotion **unaware** gems in the `:motion` Bundler group like this:

    source "http://rubygems.org"

    # RubyMotion aware gems
    gem "motion-bundler"

    # RubyMotion unaware gems
    group :motion do
      gem "slot_machine"
    end

Add `MotionBundler.setup` at the end of your `Rakefile`:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    $:.unshift "/Library/RubyMotion/lib"
    require "motion/project/template/ios"

    # Require and prepare Bundler
    require "bundler"
    Bundler.require

    Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
      # Use `rake config' to see complete project settings.
      app.name = "SampleApp"
    end

    # Track and specify files and their mutual dependencies within the :motion Bundler group
    MotionBundler.setup

Run `bundle` and then `rake` to run the application in your iOS-simulator. Voila! You're done ^^

## Huh? Haven't you written LockOMotion already?

Yes, I did. But MotionBundler ...

* is an improved rewrite of [LockOMotion](https://github.com/archan937/lock-o-motion)
* has been stripped down
* has more code abstraction (and thus has much cleaner and readable code)
* has a [test coverage percentage of 100%](https://travis-ci.org/archan937/motion-bundler)
