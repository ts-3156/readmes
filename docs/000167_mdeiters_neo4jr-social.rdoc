= neo4jr-social

Neo4jr-Social is a self contained HTTP REST + JSON interface to the graph database Neo4j. Neo4jr-Social supports simple dynamic node creation, building relationships between nodes and also includes a few common social networking queries out of the box (i.e. linkedin degrees of seperation and facebook friend suggestion) with more to come. Think of Neo4jr-Social is to Neo4j like Solr is to Lucene.

Neo4jr-Social was built in JRuby but is language agnostic and is designed to run as a self-contained service or can be deployed under Jetty or Tomcat.

= Getting Started

* rvm install jruby
* rvm use --default jruby
* gem install jruby-openssl
* gem install rake
* gem install rspec
* gem install test-client
* gem install rack-test
* gem install json-jruby -v 1.4.1
* gem install jeweler
* gem install warbler

== Running Neo4jr-Social

After installing the above gems, an executable 'start-neo4jr-social' should be in your $PATH. This will start the service and the database and listen for HTTP requests on localhost at port 8988 by default:

  start-neo4jr-social -p8988

You can also start the service and specify the directory of where the neo4j database is stored or where to create a new database. If you omit this setting a database will be created in your tmp directory and destroyed when you shutdown the server.

  start-neo4jr-social -p8988 -dsome_relative_or_absolute_directory

Run start-neo4jr-social --help to see all options
