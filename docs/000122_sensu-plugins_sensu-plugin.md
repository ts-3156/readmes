This is a framework for writing your own Sensu plugins and handlers.
It's not required to write a plugin (most Nagios plugins will work
without modification); it just makes it easier.

Examples of plugins written with and without it can be found in
the `sensu-plugins` organization.

## Checks and Metrics

To implement your own check, subclass `Sensu::Plugin::Check::CLI`, like
this:

```ruby
require 'sensu-plugin/check/cli'

class MyCheck < Sensu::Plugin::Check::CLI

  check_name 'my_awesome_check' # defaults to class name
  option :foo, :short => '-f' # Mixlib::CLI is included

  def run
    ok "All is well"
  end

end
```

This will output the string "my_awesome_check OK: All is well" (like a
Nagios plugin), and exit with a code of 0. The available exit methods,
which will immediately end the process, are:

 * `ok`
 * `warning`
 * `critical`
 * `unknown`

You can also call `message` first to set the message, then call an exit
method without any arguments (for example, if you want to choose between
WARNING and CRITICAL based on a threshold, but use the same message in
both cases).

For a metric, you can subclass one of the following:

 * `Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::JSON`
 * `Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Graphite`
 * `Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Statsd`
 * `Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Dogstatsd`
 * `Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Influxdb`
 * `Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Generic`

Instead of outputting a Nagios-style line of text, these classes will output
differently formated messages depending on the class you chose.

```ruby
require 'sensu-plugin/metric/cli'

class MyJSONMetric < Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::JSON

  def run
    ok 'foo' => 1, 'bar' => 'anything'
  end

end
```

```ruby
require 'sensu-plugin/metric/cli'

class MyGraphiteMetric < Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Graphite

  def run
    ok 'sensu.baz', 42
  end

end
```

```ruby
require 'sensu-plugin/metric/cli'

class MyStatsdMetric < Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Statsd

  def run
    ok 'sensu.baz', 42, 'g'
  end

end
```

```ruby
require 'sensu-plugin/metric/cli'

class MyDogstatsdMetric < Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Dogstatsd

  def run
    ok 'sensu.baz', 42, 'g', 'env:prod,myservice,location:us-midwest'
  end

end
```

```ruby
require 'sensu-plugin/metric/cli'

class MyInfluxdbMetric < Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Influxdb

  def run
    ok 'sensu', 'baz=42', 'env=prod,location=us-midwest'
  end

end
```

```ruby
require 'sensu-plugin/metric/cli'

class MyInfluxdbMetric < Sensu::Plugin::Metric::CLI::Generic

  def run
    ok metric_name: 'metric.name', value: 0
  end

end
```

**JSON output** takes one argument (the object), and adds a 'timestamp'
key if missing. **Graphite output** takes two arguments, the metric path
and the value, and optionally the timestamp as a third argument.
`Time.now.to_i` is used for the timestamp if it is not
specified. **Statsd output** takes three arguments, the metric path, the
value and the type.  **Dogstatsd output** takes three arguments, the
metric path, the value, the type and optionally a comma separated list
of tags, use colons for key/value tags, i.e.  `env:prod`.  **Influxdb
output** takes two arguments, the measurement name and the value or a
comma separated list of values, use `=` for field/value,
i.e. `value=42`, optionally you can also pass a comma separated list of
tags and a timestamp `Time.now.to_i` is used for the timestamp if it is
not specified.  **Generic output** takes a dictionary and can provide
requested output format with same logic. And inherited class will have a
`--metric_format` option to switch between different output formats.

Exit codes do not affect metric output, but they can still be used by
your handlers.

Some metrics may want to output multiple values in a run. To do this,
use the `output` method, with the same arguments as the exit methods, as
many times as you want, then call an exit method without any arguments.

For either checks or metrics, you can override `output` if you want
something other than these formats.

### Options

For help on setting up options, see the `mixlib-cli` documentation.
Command line arguments that are not parsed as options are available via
the `argv` method.

### Utilities

Various utility methods will be collected under Sensu::Plugin::Util.
These won't depend on any extra gems or include actual CLI checks; it's
just for common things that many checks might want to do.

## Handlers

For your own handler, subclass `Sensu::Handler`. It looks much like
checks and metrics; see the `handlers` directory for examples. Your class
should implement `handle`. The instance variable `@event` will be set
for you if a JSON event can be read from stdin; otherwise, the handler
will abort. Output to stdout will go to the log.

You can decide if you want to handle the event by overriding the
`filter` method; but this also isn't documented yet (see the source; the
built in method does some important filtering, so you probably want to
call it with `super`).

### Important!

Filtering of events is now deprecated in `Sensu::Handler` and disabled
by default as of version 2.0.

Event filtering in this library may be enabled on a per-check basis by setting
the value of the check's `enable_deprecated_filtering` attribute to `true`.

These built-in filters will be removed in a future release. See
[this blog post](https://sensuapp.org/blog/2016/07/07/sensu-plugin-filter-deprecation.html)
for more detail.


## Mutator

For your own mutator, subclass `Sensu::Mutator`. It looks much like
checks and metrics; Your class should implement `mutate`. The instance variable
`@event` will be set for you if a JSON event can be read from stdin; otherwise,
the mutator will abort. Output to stdout will then be piped through to the
handler.  As described in the docs if a mutator fails to run the event will
not be handled.

The example mutator found [here](https://sensuapp.org/docs/latest/mutators) will
look like so:

```ruby
require 'sensu-mutator'

class MyMutator < Sensu::Mutator

  def mutate
    @event.merge!(:mutated => true)
  end

end
```

## Plugin settings

Whether you are writing a check, handler or mutator, Sensu's configuration
settings are available with the `settings` method (loaded automatically
when the plugin runs). We recommend you put your custom plugin settings
in a JSON file in `/etc/sensu/conf.d`, with a unique top-level key,
e.g. `my_custom_plugin`:

```json
{
  "my_custom_plugin": {
    "foo": true,
    "bar": false
  }
}
```

And access them in your plugin like so:

```ruby
def foo_enabled?
  settings['my_custom_plugin']['foo']
end
```

## Sensu Go enablement

This plugin provides basic Sensu Go enablement support to make it possible to continue to use existing Sensu plugin handlers and mutators for Sensu Core 1.x event model in a backwards compatible fashion.

### Sensu Go event mapping

The provided mutator command `mutator-sensu-go-into-ruby.rb` will mutate the Sensu Go event into a form compatible for handlers written to consume Sensu Core 1.x events.  Users may find this mutator useful until such time that community plugin handler are updated to support Sensu Go event model directly.

Sensu plugins which provide either mutators or handlers can benefit from provided Sensu Go enablement support in the form of mixin commandline option support.  Once plugins update to the latest sensu-plugin version, all mutator and handler commands will automatically grow an additional commandline argument `--map_go_event_into_ruby`

### Custom attributes

For backwards compatibility, you can store custom entity and check attributes as a json string in a specially named annotation. By default the annotation key is `sensu.io.json_attributes`, but can be overridden using the environment variable `MAP_ANNOTATION`.  The json string stored in the `MAP_ANNOTATION` key will be converted into a ruby hash and merged into the ruby event hash object as part of the event mapping.
