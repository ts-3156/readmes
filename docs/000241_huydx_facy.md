Facy is a terminal client for facebook, which support streaming-like feature.
Only supports Ruby 1.9 and later.
To install facy, we need ruby pre-installed, please refer to https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/ to know how to install ruby.
I recommend rvm to control the version of installed ruby.

Imageview by asii-art also available by option config, however image quality is quite bad, so it seems quite useless.
