## Overview

Rails Workflow allows you to organize your application business logic by joining user- and auto- operations in processes. You can
configure, create and manage processes to easily build project management systems, sales / product provisioning systems,
ERP, CMS, etc.

Rails Workflow is mountable Rails engine and can be mounted to any Rails application.

All processes, configurations, operations and their data is persisted for processing and supporting purposes.
Engine has UI to configure process templates and manage existing processes.

## Installation

Add to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_workflow'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

and mount it to /workflow routes:
```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  ...
  mount RailsWorkflow::Engine => '/workflow', as: 'workflow'
  ...
end
```
Generate all models:
```sh
$ rails generate rails_workflow:install
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

I am developing this engine using PostgreSQL database. In case if you using MySQL, add following
to your config/initializers/workflow.rb file:
```ruby
RailsWorkflow.setup do |config|
  config.sql_dialect= 'mysql'
end
```
