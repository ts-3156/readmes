# Dawnscanner - The raising security scanner for ruby web applications

dawnscanner is a source code scanner designed to review your ruby code for security
issues.

dawnscanner is able to scan plain ruby scripts (e.g. command line applications) but
all its features are unleashed when dealing with web applications source code.
dawnscanner is able to scan major MVC (Model View Controller) frameworks, out of the
box:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)
* [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com)
* [Padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com)

## Quick update from November, 2018

As you can see dawnscanner is on hold since more then an year. Sorry for that.
It's life. I was overwhelmed by tons of stuff and I dedicated free time to
Offensive Security certifications. True to be told, I'm starting OSCE journey
really soon.

The dawnscanner project will be updated soon with new security checks and
kickstarted again.

dawnscanner version 1.6.6 has 235 security checks loaded in its knowledge
base. Most of them are CVE bulletins applying to gems or the ruby interpreter
itself. There are also some check coming from Owasp Ruby on Rails cheatsheet.

## An overall introduction

When you run dawnscanner on your code it parses your project Gemfile.lock
looking for the gems used and it tries to detect the ruby interpreter version
you are using or you declared in your ruby version management tool you like
most (RVM, rbenv, ...).

Then the tool tries to detect the MVC framework your web application uses and
it applies the security check accordingly. There checks designed to match rails
application or checks that are appliable to any ruby code.

dawnscanner can also understand the code in your views and to backtrack
sinks to spot cross site scripting and sql injections introduced by the code
you actually wrote. In the project roadmap this is the code most of the future
development effort will be focused on.

dawnscanner security scan result is a list of vulnerabilities with some
mitigation actions you want to follow in order to build a stronger web
application.

## Installation

You can install latest dawnscanner version, fetching it from
[Rubygems](https://rubygems.org) by typing:

```
$ gem install dawnscanner 
```

If you want to add dawn to your project Gemfile, you must add the following:

    group :development do
      gem 'dawnscanner', :require=>false
    end

And then upgrade your bundle

    $ bundle install

You may want to build it from source, so you have to check it out from github first:

    $ git clone https://github.com/thesp0nge/dawnscanner.git
    $ cd dawnscanner
    $ bundle install
    $ rake install

And the dawnscanner gem will be built in a pkg directory and then installed
on your system. Please note that you have to manage dependencies on your own
this way. It makes sense only if you want to hack the code or something like
that.

## Usage

You can start your code review with dawnscanner very easily. Simply tell the tool
where the project root directory.

Underlying MVC framework is autodetected by dawnscanner using target Gemfile.lock
file. If autodetect fails for some reason, the tool will complain about it and
you have to specify if it's a rails, sinatra or padrino web application by
hand.

Basic usage is to specify some optional command line option to fit best your
needs, and to specify the target directory where your code is stored.

```
$ dawn [options] target
```

In case of need, there is a quick command line option reference running 
```dawn -h``` at your OS prompt.

```
$ dawn -h
Usage: dawn [options] target_directory

Examples:
	$ dawn a_sinatra_webapp_directory
	$ dawn -C the_rails_blog_engine
	$ dawn -C --json a_sinatra_webapp_directory
	$ dawn --ascii-tabular-report my_rails_blog_ecommerce
	$ dawn --html -F my_report.html my_rails_blog_ecommerce

   -G, --gem-lock				force dawn to scan only for vulnerabilities affecting dependencies in Gemfile.lock (DEPRECATED)
   -d, --dependencies				force dawn to scan only for vulnerabilities affecting dependencies in Gemfile.lock

Reporting

   -a, --ascii-tabular-report			cause dawn to format findings using tables in ascii art (DEPRECATED)
   -j, --json					cause dawn to format findings using json
   -K, --console					cause dawn to format findings using plain ascii text
   -C, --count-only				dawn will only count vulnerabilities (useful for scripts)
   -z, --exit-on-warn				dawn will return number of found vulnerabilities as exit code
   -F, --file filename				tells dawn to write output to filename
   -c, --config-file filename			tells dawn to load configuration from filename

Disable security check family

       --disable-cve-bulletins			disable all CVE security checks
       --disable-code-quality			disable all code quality checks
       --disable-code-style			disable all code style checks
       --disable-owasp-ror-cheatsheet		disable all Owasp Ruby on Rails cheatsheet checks
       --disable-owasp-top-10			disable all Owasp Top 10 checks

Flags useful to query Dawn

   -S, --search-knowledge-base [check_name]	search check_name in the knowledge base
       --list-knowledge-base			list knowledge-base content
       --list-known-families			list security check families contained in dawn's knowledge base
       --list-known-framework			list ruby MVC frameworks supported by dawn
       --list-scan-registry			list past scan informations stored in scan registry 

Service flags

   -D, --debug					enters dawn debug mode
   -V, --verbose				the output will be more verbose
   -v, --version				show version information
   -h, --help					show this help
```

### Rake task

To include dawnscanner in your rake task list, you simply have to put this line in
your ```Rakefile```

```
require 'dawn/tasks'
```

Then executing ```$ rake -T``` you will have a ```dawn:run``` task you want to
execute.

```
$ rake -T
...
rake dawn:run                  # Execute dawnscanner on the current directory
...
```

### Interacting with the knowledge base

You can dump all security checks in the knowledge base this way

```
$ dawn --list-knowledge-base
```

Useful in scripts, you can use ```--search-knowledge-base``` or ```-S``` with
as parameter the check name you want to see if it's implemented as a security
control or not.

```
$ dawn -S CVE-2013-6421
07:59:30 [*] dawn v1.1.0 is starting up
CVE-2013-6421 found in knowledgebase.

$ dawn -S this_test_does_not_exist
08:02:17 [*] dawn v1.1.0 is starting up
this_test_does_not_exist not found in knowledgebase
```

### dawnscanner security scan in action

As output, dawnscanner will put all security checks that are failed during the scan.

This the result of Codedake::dawnscanner running against a
[Sinatra 1.4.2 web application](https://github.com/thesp0nge/railsberry2013) wrote for a talk I
delivered in 2013 at [Railsberry conference](http://www.railsberry.com).

As you may see, dawnscanner first detects MVC running the application by
looking at Gemfile.lock, than it discards all security checks not appliable to
Sinatra (49 security checks, in version 1.0, especially designed for Ruby on
Rails) and it applies them.

```
$ dawn ~/src/hacking/railsberry2013
18:40:27 [*] dawn v1.1.0 is starting up
18:40:27 [$] dawn: scanning /Users/thesp0nge/src/hacking/railsberry2013
18:40:27 [$] dawn: sinatra v1.4.2 detected
18:40:27 [$] dawn: applying all security checks
18:40:27 [$] dawn: 109 security checks applied - 0 security checks skipped
18:40:27 [$] dawn: 1 vulnerabilities found
18:40:27 [!] dawn: CVE-2013-1800 check failed
18:40:27 [$] dawn: Severity: high
18:40:27 [$] dawn: Priority: unknown
18:40:27 [$] dawn: Description: The crack gem 0.3.1 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for (1) YAML type conversion or (2) Symbol type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
18:40:27 [$] dawn: Solution: Please use crack gem version 0.3.2 or above. Correct your gemfile
18:40:27 [$] dawn: Evidence:
18:40:27 [$] dawn:      Vulnerable crack gem version found: 0.3.1
18:40:27 [*] dawn is leaving
```

When you run dawnscanner on a web application with up to date dependencies,
it's likely to return a friendly _no vulnerabilities found_ message. Keep it up
working that way!

This is dawnscanner running against a Padrino web application I wrote for [a
scorecard quiz game about application security](http://scorecard.armoredcode.com).
Italian language only. Sorry.

```
18:42:39 [*] dawn v1.1.0 is starting up
18:42:39 [$] dawn: scanning /Users/thesp0nge/src/CORE_PROJECTS/scorecard
18:42:39 [$] dawn: padrino v0.11.2 detected
18:42:39 [$] dawn: applying all security checks
18:42:39 [$] dawn: 109 security checks applied - 0 security checks skipped
18:42:39 [*] dawn: no vulnerabilities found.
18:42:39 [*] dawn is leaving
```

If you need a fancy HTML report about your scan, just ask it to dawnscanner
with the ```--html``` flag used with the ```--file``` since I wanto to save the
HTML to disk.

```
$ dawn /Users/thesp0nge/src/hacking/rt_first_app --html --file report.html

09:00:54 [*] dawn v1.1.0 is starting up
09:00:54 [*] dawn: report.html created (2952 bytes)
09:00:54 [*] dawn is leaving
```
