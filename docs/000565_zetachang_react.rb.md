# React.rb has been renamed to [Reactrb](https://github.com/reactrb) and moved to https://github.com/reactrb

Why?  

So that we can consistently use the name *Reactrb* everywhere - domain names, twitter, github repos etc.

Everything else remains the same (and gets better everyday thanks to our great contributers and users.)
