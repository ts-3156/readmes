# motion-settings-bundle

Create a Settings.bundle for your RubyMotion app. This allows your app to have a "global" settings entry in the Settings app.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'motion-settings-bundle'

And then execute:

    bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install motion-settings-bundle

## Usage

Add a chunk of code into your project's `Rakefile` like so:

``` ruby
require 'motion-settings-bundle'

Motion::SettingsBundle.setup do |app|
  # A text field. Allows configuration of a string.
  app.text "Name", key: "username", default: "Paul Atreides"
  app.text "E-mail", key: "email", keyboard: "EmailAddress", autocapitalization: "None"
  app.text "Password", key: "password", secure: true

  # A read-only text field. Use for showing a small chunk of text, maybe a version number
  app.title "Year of Birth", key: "yearOfBirth", default: "10,175 AG"

  # An on/off switch. Turn something on or off. Default is `false` (off).
  app.toggle "Kwisatz Haderach?", key: "superpowersEnabled", default: true

  # MultiValue, to choose from some item
  app.multivalue "Picture Resolution 1", key: "pictureResolution1", default: "1500", values: ["1500", "1200", "1000"]

  # MultiValue 2, with values and different titles (required when the values are numbers not string)
  app.multivalue "Picture Resolution 2", key: "pictureResolution2", default: 1500, values: [1500, 1200, 1000],
    titles: ["1500px", "1200px", "1000px"]

  # A slider, configure volume or something linear
  app.slider "Spice Level", key: "spiceLevel", default: 50, min: 1, max: 100

  # Child pane to display licenses in
  app.child "Acknowledgements" do |ack|
    ack.child "AwesomeOSSLibrary" do |lic|
      lic.group "Copyright 2013 AwesomeOSSContributor"
      lic.group "More license text that is terribly formatted but fulfills legal requirements"
    end
  end
end
```

Now just run `rake` as normal!

This should now add a `Settings.bundle` folder into your `resources` directory. Make sure to commit it! If you ever change the data in the `Settings.setup` block, it will be re-built on the next `rake` run. You'll end up with something like this:

![screenshot2 of motion-settings-bundle](https://raw.github.com/qrush/motion-settings-bundle/master/screenshot2.png)
![screenshot3 of motion-settings-bundle](https://raw.github.com/qrush/motion-settings-bundle/master/screenshot3.png)

If you're wondering how to access this in code, it's pretty easy:

``` ruby
NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults["username"]
# returns "Paul Atreides"
```

And so on. Just remember, the defaults aren't populated until your user actually opens the Settings app, so make sure to handle all of your setting entries being `nil`.

## TODO

This project really solely exists to avoid creating/editing the Settings.bundle in XCode. The specs for it so far have been based off [mordaroso/rubymotion-settings-bundle](https://github/mordaroso/rubymotion-settings-bundle). Please feel free to contribute more ways to generate settings!

* Add a custom label, "Settings for Blah"
* Don't re-create files every time
* Slider default level doesn't seem to work yet

## Contributing

I couldn't figure out how to test this automatically. Run `bundle` to get the gems you need, and then `rake` to generate a RubyMotion app in the iOS simulator, and then open the Settings app.

If you've added a setting it would be really nice if you could update `screenshot.png` as well!
