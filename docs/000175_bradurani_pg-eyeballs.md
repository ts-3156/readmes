# pg-eyeballs ðŸ‘€

`pg-eyeballs` is a ruby gem that gives you detailed information about how the
SQL queries created by the active record code you write are executed by the database.
It gives you an easy, ruby friendly way to see the output of the Postgres
[`EXPLAIN` command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/using-explain.html) and integrates with the popular query analysis tool [`gocmdpev`](https://github.com/simon-engledew/gocmdpev).

Using it you can see:
- What queries were run
- How long they took
- Which indexes were used
- Which algorithms were used
- Much more!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pg-eyeballs'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pg-eyeballs

## Usage

### explain(options: [:analyze, :verbose, :costs, :buffers], format: :text)

```ruby
User.all.eyeballs.explain

["Seq Scan on public.users  (cost=0.00..22.30 rows=1230 width=36) (actual time=0.002..0.002 rows=1 loops=1)
    Output: id, email
    Buffers: shared hit=1
  Planning time: 0.014 ms
  Execution time: 0.009 ms"
]
```
Most eyeballs methods return an array because an `ActiveRecord::Relation` can run
more than one query, for instance when it has a `preload` or with certain
subqueries
```ruby
User.all.preload(:profiles).eyeballs.explain(options: [:verbose], format: :yaml)
['- Plan:
      Node Type: "Seq Scan"
      Relation Name: "users"
      Schema: "public"
      Alias: "users"
      Startup Cost: 0.00
      Total Cost: 22.30
      Plan Rows: 1230
      Plan Width: 36
      Output:
      - "id"
      - "email"',
 '- Plan:
      Node Type: "Seq Scan"
      Relation Name: "profiles"
      Schema: "public"
      Alias: "profiles"
      Startup Cost: 0.00\
      Total Cost: 36.75
      Plan Rows: 11
      Plan Width: 8
      Output:
        - "id"
        - "user_id"
      Filter: "(profiles.user_id = 1)"'
]
```
**formats:** :text, :xml, :json, :yaml

### explain_queries(options: [:analyze, :verbose, :costs, :buffers], format: :text)
```ruby
User.all.preload(:profiles).eyeballs.explain_queries
["EXPLAIN (ANALYZE,VERBOSE,COSTS,BUFFERS,FORMAT TEXT) SELECT \"users\".* FROM \"users\"",
 "EXPLAIN (ANALYZE,VERBOSE,COSTS,BUFFERS,FORMAT TEXT) SELECT \"profiles\".* FROM \"profiles\" WHERE \"profiles\".\"user_id\" IN (1)"]
 ```
**formats:** :text, :xml, :json, :yaml

### log_json(options: [:analyze, :verbose, :costs, :buffers])
Prints each JSON plan on a separate line. This is useful for command line
processing with [`xargs`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xargs) and [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or
[`gocmdpev`](https://github.com/simon-engledew/gocmdpev)
```ruby
User.all.preload(:profiles).eyeballs.log_json
```

### queries
```ruby
User.all.preload(:profiles).eyeballs.queries
["SELECT \"users\".* FROM \"users\"",
 "SELECT \"profiles\".* FROM \"profiles\" WHERE \"profiles\".\"user_id\" IN (1)"]
 ```

### to_hash_array(options: [:analyze, :verbose, :costs, :buffers])
```ruby
User.all.eyeballs.to_hash_array
[[{"Plan"=>{
    "Node Type"=>"Seq Scan",
    "Relation Name"=>"users",
    "Schema"=>"public",
    "Alias"=>"users",
    "Startup Cost"=>0.0,
    "Total Cost"=>22.3,
    "Plan Rows"=>1230,
    "Plan Width"=>36,
    "Actual Startup Time"=>0.001,
    "Actual Total Time"=>0.001,
    "Actual Rows"=>1,

    "Output"=>["id", "email"],

    "Shared Read Blocks"=>0,
    "Shared Dirtied Blocks"=>0,
    "Shared Written Blocks"=>0,
    "Local Hit Blocks"=>0,
    "Local Read Blocks"=>0,
    "Local Dirtied Blocks"=>0,
    "Local Written Blocks"=>0,
    "Temp Read Blocks"=>0,
    "Temp Written Blocks"=>0,
    "I/O Read Time"=>0.0,
    "I/O Write Time"=>0.0},
    "Planning Time"=>0.014,
    "Triggers"=>[],
    "Execution Time"=>0.007}]
]
```

### to_json(options: [:analyze, :verbose, :costs, :buffers])
**alias for** `explain(format: :json)`

### to_s(options: [:analyze, :verbose, :costs, :buffers])

```ruby
User.all.preload(:profiles).eyeballs.to_s
"Seq Scan on public.users  (cost=0.00..22.30 rows=1230 width=36) (actual time=0.001..0.002 rows=1 loops=1)
  Output: id, email
  Buffers: shared hit=1
Planning time: 0.010 ms
Execution time: 0.005 ms

Seq Scan on public.profiles  (cost=0.00..36.75 rows=11 width=8) (actual time=0.002..0.002 rows=1 loops=1)
  Output: id, user_id
  Filter: (profiles.user_id = 1)
  Buffers: shared hit=1
Planning time: 0.013 ms
Execution time: 0.006 ms"
```

## Integration with `gocmdpev`

`pg-eyeballs` integrates with
[`gocmdpev`](https://github.com/simon-engledew/gocmdpev). If you have `gocmdpev`
installed, you can use it in your Rails console:
```ruby
User.all.preload(:profiles).eyeballs.gocmdpev
```

![gocmdpev](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradurani/pg-eyeballs/master/gocmdpev.png "Using
gocmdpev in the Rails console")

You can also use `pg-eyeballs` and `gocmdpev` together from the command line.
First, alias the included command. From inside the directory of you Rails
project run
```bash
alias eyeballs=$(bundle show pg-eyeballs)/bin/gocmdpev
```
To use, also from inside your Rails project directory, run
```bash
eyeballs User.preload(:profiles)
```

## Compatibility

`pg-eyeballs` has been tested with Rails versions 4 and 5. It may work on
earlier versions, but I haven't tried it.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/bradurani/pg-eyeballs. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

### Running the tests

First, `bundle install`. After this, if you are using the default
database, first thing is to run `createdb eyeballs_test`. After this
you can run the tests with `rake`.
