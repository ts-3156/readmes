# MethodDecorators

Python's function decorators for Ruby.

I probably wouldn't use this in production.

## Installation
`gem install method_decorators`

## Usage

### Using a decorator
Extend MethodDecorators in a class where you want to use them, and then stick `+DecoratorName` before your method declaration to decorate the method.

```ruby
require "method_decorators/memoize"

class MyMath
  extend MethodDecorators

  +MethodDecorators::Memoize
  def self.fib(n)
    if n <= 1
      n
    else
      fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
  end
end

puts MyMath.fib(200)
```

You can also decorate with an instance of a decorator, rather than the class. This is useful for configuring specific options for the decorator.

```ruby
class ExternalService
  extend MethodDecorators

  +MethodDecorators::Retry.new(3)
  def request
    ...
  end
end
```

You can also set multiple decorators for your methods. Each decorator executes within the previously declared decorator. i.e. they are nested, as expected to be.

```ruby
class ExternalService
  extend MethodDecorators

  +MethodDecorators::Retry.new(3)
  +MethodDecorators::Within.new(2.seconds)
  def request
    ...
  end
end
```

### Included decorators

Include these with `require 'method_decorators/name_of_decorator'`, or all at once with `require 'method_decorators/all'`.

- Memoize - caches the result of the method for each arg combination it's called with
- Retry - retries the method up to n (passed in to the constructor) times if the method errors
- Within - times outs if a request doesn't complete within n seconds
- Precondition - raises an error if the precondition (passed as a block) is not met

### Defining a decorator

```ruby
class Transactional < MethodDecorators::Decorator
  def call(wrapped, this, *args, &blk)
    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      wrapped.call(*args, &blk)
    end
  end
end
```
