# Searchjoy

Search analytics made easy

[See it in action](https://searchjoy.herokuapp.com/)

- view searches in real-time
- track conversions week over week
- monitor the performance of top searches

Works with any search platform, including Elasticsearch, Sphinx, and Solr

:cupid: An amazing companion to [Searchkick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick)

## Get Started

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "searchjoy"
```

And run the generator. This creates a migration to store searches.

```sh
rails generate searchjoy:install
rails db:migrate
```

Next, add the dashboard to your `config/routes.rb`.

```ruby
mount Searchjoy::Engine, at: "searchjoy"
```

Be sure to protect the endpoint in production - see the [Authentication](#authentication) section for ways to do this.

### Track Searches

Track searches by creating a record in the database.

```ruby
Searchjoy::Search.create(
  search_type: "Item", # typically the model name
  query: "apple",
  results_count: 12,
  user_id: 1
)
```

With [Searchkick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick), you can use the `track` option to do this automatically.

```ruby
Item.search "apple", track: {user_id: 1}
```

If you want to track more attributes, add them to the `searchjoy_searches` table.  Then, pass the values to the `track` option.

```ruby
Item.search "apple", track: {user_id: 1, source: "web"}
```

It’s that easy.

### Track Conversions

First, choose a conversion metric. At Instacart, an item added to the cart from the search results page counts as a conversion.

Next, when a user searches, keep track of the search id. With Searchkick, you can get the id with `@results.search.id`.

When a user converts, find the record and call `convert`.

```ruby
search = Searchjoy::Search.find(params[:id])
search.convert
```

Better yet, record the model that converted.

```ruby
item = Item.find(params[:item_id])
search.convert(item)
```

### Authentication

Don’t forget to protect the dashboard in production.

#### Devise

In your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
authenticate :user, ->(user) { user.admin? } do
  mount Searchjoy::Engine, at: "searchjoy"
end
```

#### Basic Authentication

Set the following variables in your environment or an initializer.

```ruby
ENV["SEARCHJOY_USERNAME"] = "andrew"
ENV["SEARCHJOY_PASSWORD"] = "secret"
```

### Customize

To change the time zone, create an initializer `config/initializers/searchjoy.rb` with:

```ruby
Searchjoy.time_zone = "Pacific Time (US & Canada)" # defaults to Time.zone
```

Change the number of top searches shown with:

```ruby
Searchjoy.top_searches = 500 # defaults to 100
```

Link to the search results [master]

```ruby
Searchjoy.query_url = ->(search) { Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.items_path(q: search.query) }
```

Add additional info to the query in the live stream.

```ruby
Searchjoy.query_name = ->(search) { "#{search.query} #{search.city}" }
```

Show the conversion name in the live stream.

```ruby
Searchjoy.conversion_name = ->(model) { model.name }
```

## TODO

- customize views
- analytics for individual queries
- group similar queries
- track pagination, facets, sorting, etc
