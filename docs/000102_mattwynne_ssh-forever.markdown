Simple command to give you password-less SSH login on remote servers:

    see `ssh-forever --help` for details on the options availlable.

## Installation

    gem install ssh-forever

## Example:

    [matt@bowie ssh-forever (master)]$ ssh-forever mattwynne@mattwynne.net -n dreamhost
    You do not appear to have a public key. I expected to find one at /Users/matt/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    Would you like me to generate one? [Y/n]y
    Copying your public key to the remote server. Prepare to enter your password for the last time.
    mattwynne@mattwynne.net's password:
    Success. From now on you can just use plain old 'ssh'. Logging you in...

## Why?

Because I can never remember how to do it by hand. Now I don't have to, and nor do you.

##Â What about ssh-copy-id?

I'll admit that I wasn't aware of the [ssh-copy-id](http://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-copy-id) unix 
command when I wrote this tool. The main advantage that `ssh-forever` has over `ssh-copy-id` is that it 
will automatically generate a public key for you if you don't already have one, making it a bit more
user-friendly if you're not familiar with the SSH key system.

You should probably try `ssh-copy-id` first. Many linux distros come with it built in. OSX users
can install it with `brew install ssh-copy-id`
