# Procodile üêä

Running & deploying Ruby apps to places like [Viaduct](https://viaduct.io) & Heroku is really easy but running processes on actual servers is less fun. Procodile aims to take some the stress out of running your Ruby/Rails apps and give you some of the useful process management features you get from the takes of the PaaS providers.

Procodile is a bit like [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) but things are designed to run in the background (as well as the foreground if you prefer) and there's a supervisor which keeps an eye on your processes and will respawn them if they die.

Procodile works out of the box with your existing `Procfile`.
