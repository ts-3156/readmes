# Style Prototypes

Bower package containing webapp brains and core styling for a Style Prototype.

## Installation

For setting up a new Style Prototype generator, see [these instructions](https://github.com/north/generator-Style-Prototype#installation).

## Usage

Include the following in your HTML head:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/style-prototype/css/prototype.css">
```

Include the following before your closing `<body>` tag and before other JavaScript you want to include:

```html
<script src="bower_components/style-prototype/dist/style-prototype.js"></script>
```

## Customizing Prototype Styling

Style Prototypes comes with a partial, `_style-prototype.scss`, that can be imported and used to custom style the prototype CSS. Or you can just write your own!
