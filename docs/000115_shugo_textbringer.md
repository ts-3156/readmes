Textbringer is a member of a demon race that takes on the form of an Emacs-like
text editor.

## Demo

* FizzBuzz: https://asciinema.org/a/103357
* Ruby Programming: https://asciinema.org/a/100156
* Japanese Text Editing: https://asciinema.org/a/100166

## WARNING

Textbringer is beta software, and you may lose your text.  Unsaved buffers will
be dumped in ~/.textbringer/buffer_dump on crash.

APIs are undocumented and unstable.  There is no compatibility even in the same
minor versions.

## Installation

    $ gem install textbringer

You need ncursesw to use multibyte characters.
Install ncursesw before installing curses.gem, on which textbringer depends.

    $ sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev
    $ gem install curses

## Usage

    $ textbringer

You can quit the editor by `Ctrl-x Ctrl-c`.

Many commands and key bindings are similar to [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

Type `F1 b` or `Alt+x describe_bindings RET` to see key bindings.

## Configuration

### Meta key

You need the following configuration of terminal emulators to use meta key.

#### xterm

Add the following line to ~/.Xresources.

    XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true

#### mlterm

Add the following lines to ~/.mlterm/main.

    mod_meta_key = alt
    mod_meta_mode = esc

### East asian ambiguous width

Add the following line to ~/.textbringer.rb to treat
[ambiguous characters](http://unicode.org/reports/tr11/#Ambiguous)
as fullwidth.

    CONFIG[:east_asian_ambiguous_width] = 2

You also need a LD_PRELOAD hack or a modified locale charmap because ncursesw
uses wcwidth(3).

xterm, mlterm and screen have their own configuration options.

#### xterm

Add the following lines to ~/.Xresources.

    xterm*utf8: 1
    xterm*locale: true
    xterm*cjkWidth: true

#### mlterm

Add the following line to ~/.mlterm/main.

    col_size_of_width_a = 2

#### screen

Add the following line to ~/.screenrc.

    cjkwidth on

## Development
