Landrush is a simple cross-platform DNS for Vagrant VMs that is visible
on both, the guest and the host.

It spins up a small DNS server and redirects DNS traffic from your VMs
to use it, automatically registering/unregistering IP addresses of
guests as they come up and go down.

== Installation

Install under Vagrant (1.1 or later):

....
$ vagrant plugin install landrush
....

== Getting started

.  Enable the plugin in your `Vagrantfile`:
+
....
config.landrush.enabled = true
....
.  Bring up a machine.
+
....
$ vagrant up
....
.  You are able to get your VM's hostname resolved on your host:
+
....
$ dig -p 10053 @localhost myhost.vagrant.test
....
.  If you shut down your guest, the entries associated with it will be removed.

Landrush retrieves your VM's hostname from either the vagrant config or
it uses the system's actual hostname by running the `hostname` command.
A default hostname of "guest-vm" is assumed if the hostname is otherwise not
available.

A Landrush example configuration could look like this:

....
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"

  config.landrush.enabled = true

  config.vm.hostname = "myhost.vagrant.test"

  config.landrush.host 'static1.example.com', '1.2.3.4'
  config.landrush.host 'static2.example.com', '2.3.4.5'
end
....

See the link:doc/Usage.adoc[Usage guide] for further information.

Check out `vagrant landrush help` for the available commands.

....
