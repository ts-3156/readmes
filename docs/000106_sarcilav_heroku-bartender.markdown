Is a simple way to manage releases in heroku

# How to bartender
## Install
        gem install heroku-bartender
## Run
        heroku-bartender
## Options
Server options:

		-h, --host=HOST              The hostname or ip of the host to bind to (default 0.0.0.0)
		-p, --port=PORT              The port to listen on (default 4567)
		-t, --target=TARGET          The target is the git remote in which you want to deploy (default heroku)
		--user=USER                  The user to login using HTTP Basic Auth
