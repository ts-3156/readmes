`plotfx` is a standalone tool for creating charts and other data-driven graphics.

Charts can be customized using a lightweight syntax that is very similar to CSS.
You can run PlotFX from the command line, where it generates SVG, PNG and PDF
output files. Additionally, you can embed it into your own application using the
C API.

PlotFX is partially based on ideas from the "Grammar of Graphics" [0].
One of the main goals for PlotFX is that creating charts should be quick, simple
and fun.

**WARNING**: The project is currently a work-in-progress. I'm currently working
on removing the old SQL chart specification language and replacing it with the
new CSS-like syntax. This might take a while...

Getting Started
---------------

Here is how to create a simple line chart using plotfx:

    $ plotfx --in example_chart.ptx --out example_chart.svg

Output File (`example_chart.svg`):

[![A simple line chart](/examples/linecharts/lines_with_points.svg)](./examples/linecharts/lines_with_points.ptx)

Input File (`example_chart.ptx`):

    data: csv('tests/testdata/city_temperatures.csv');
    x: month;
    y: temperature;
    group: city;

    scale-y-min: -10;
    scale-y-max: 32;

    layer {
      type: lines;
      stroke: 2pt;
    }

    legend {
      position: top left inside;
    }


For more examples, please see [the examples page](https://plotfx.org/examples).


Building
--------

To build PlotFX, you need an up-to-date C++ compiler, cmake, libharfbuzz and
libfreetype. Run:

    $ cmake .
    $ make

To install the `plotfx` binary into your system, run `make install`:

    $ make install

To run the test suite, run `make test`:

    $ make test

Parts of the new chart specification syntax and semantics were inspired by ideas
from the "Grammar of Graphics" [0] and the ggplot2 project.
