tabula-extractor (old version)
==============================

**Deprecation Note:** *This is the old version of the Tabula extraction engine. New projects wishing to integrate Tabula should use <b>[tabula-java][tabula-java] (the new Java version of this extraction engine)</b> unless you prefer to use JRuby. Users looking for the command-line version of Tabula should also use <b>[tabula-java][tabula-java]</b>.*

Extract tables from PDF files. `tabula-extractor` is the table extraction engine that used to power [Tabula](http://tabula.nerdpower.org).

If you're beginning a new project, consider using [tabula-java](http://www.github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java), a pure-Java version of the extraction engine behind Tabula. If you want Ruby bindings and are okay using JRuby (or have already begin a project), you may continue to use this project. This project's JRuby backend has been replaced with the Java backend; all that remains here is a thin wrapper for Ruby compatibility. This wrapper maintains API backwards-compatibility with the old, pure-JRuby implementation that we all know and love.


## Installation

`tabula-extractor` only works with JRuby 1.7 or newer. [Install JRuby](http://jruby.org/getting-started) and run

``
jruby -S gem install tabula-extractor
``

## Scripting examples

`tabula-extractor` is a RubyGem that you can use to programmatically extract tabular data, using the Tabula engine, in your scripts or applications. We don't have docs yet, but [the tests](test/tests.rb) are a good source of information.

Here's a very basic example:

````ruby
require 'tabula'

pdf_file_path = "whatever.pdf"
outfilename = "whatever.csv"

out = open(outfilename, 'w')

extractor = Tabula::Extraction::ObjectExtractor.new(pdf_file_path, :all )
extractor.extract.each do |pdf_page|
  pdf_page.spreadsheets.each do |spreadsheet|
    out << spreadsheet.to_csv
    out << "\n\n"
  end
end
out.close

````
