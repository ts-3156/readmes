Dear Ariejan – I am corporate counsel for Amazon.com, Inc., working with IMDb. We have become aware of your “IMDb gem” available at the github page referenced in the subject line. IMDb demands that you cease and desist from continuing to offer this software on github or any other source.
 
As IMDb’s Conditions of Use explicitly state, “You may not use data mining, robots, screen scraping, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on this site, except with our express written consent as noted below.”
  
Based upon my review of the above referenced github site, the “IMDb gem” falls into this prohibition. Additionally, this gem allows facilitates third parties violating IMDb’s copyright in its data compilation on IMDb.com.
   
IMDb retains all rights and remedies available to it.
    
Regards,
Noah ********
