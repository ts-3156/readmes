```
  grat·i·cule |ˈgratəˌkyoōl|
    Navigation. a network of parallels and meridians on a map or chart.
```

Graticule is a geocoding API for looking up address coordinates and performing distance calculations. It supports many popular APIs:

* Mapbox
* Yahoo
* Google
* MapQuest
* Geocoder.ca
* Geocoder.us
* Geonames
* SimpleGeo
* Postcode Anywhere
* MetaCarta
* FreeThePostcode
* LocalSearchMaps
* Yandex

### Installation

```
gem install graticule
```

### Usage

There is a companion Rails plugin called [acts_as_geocodable](https://github.com/collectiveidea/acts_as_geocodable) that makes geocoding seem like magic.

Graticule exposes to main APIs: location search and distance calculations. Graticule also
provides a command line utility.

#### Location Search / Geocoding

```
require 'rubygems'
require 'graticule'

geocoder = Graticule.service(:google).new "api_key"
location = geocoder.locate("61 East 9th Street, Holland, MI")
```

For specific service documentation, please visit the [documentation](http://rdoc.info/github/collectiveidea/graticule).

#### Distance Calculation

Graticule includes 3 different distance formulas, Spherical (simplest but least accurate), Vincenty (most accurate and most complicated), and Haversine (somewhere inbetween). The default is Haversine. There are two ways to calculate the distance between two points.

First is `Location#distance_to`:

```
holland = geocoder.locate("Holland, MI")
chicago = geocoder.locate("Chicago, IL")
holland.distance_to(chicago, :formula => :haversine) # or :spherical or :vincenty
# => 101.997458788177
```

You can also use the formula classes directly:

```
Graticule::Distance::Haversine.distance(holland, chicago)
# => 101.997458788177
```

All units are miles by default, but you can switch to kilometers with the `units` option

```
holland.distance_to(chicago, :units => :kilometers)
#
Graticule::Distance::Haversine.distance(holland, chicago, :kilometers)
```


#### Command Line

Graticule includes a command line interface (CLI). The CLI does not currently support all of the implemented services.

```
$ geocode -s google -a [api_key] Washington, DC
Washington, DC US
latitude: 38.895222, longitude: -77.036758
```
