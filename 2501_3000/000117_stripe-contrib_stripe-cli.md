# Stripe::CLI
stripe-cli is the command line interface to [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

Offering a friendly, intuitive interface to the entire API via a git-style command suite.

With an emphasis on convenience and productivity and a commitment to pretty, colorful, but most of all READABLE output.


Uses [AwesomePrint](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print) to provide very readable output on your command line.

![example output](./output.png)

## Installation

    $ gem install stripe-cli

## Configuration

For authentication, pass your secret key using the `-k` or `--key` option

    $ stripe events list -k sk_test_abcdef123456

To use a specific api version, pass in the `-v` or `--version` option

    $ stripe balance_transactions list -v "2014-08-04"

Explicitly passing in configuration every time is tedious. Avoid it by creating a configuration file that contains this data.

Stripe-CLI will check your home folder (**~/**) for the existance of a `.stripecli` file that conforms to the following example

![example config file](./example.png)

If this file exists, the specified default configuration is picked up and used automatically.

The current directory is now also checked for the existance of a `.stripecli` file. In which case, that file is used instead.

As shown in the above example, you may set multiple configuration **environments** in a single file. Just make sure to specify a default.

The default **environment** may be overridden by passing in the `-e` or `--env` option to any command

    $ stripe customers find cust_123 --env=live

If you manage separate Stripe accounts for several projects, I suggest creating a simple `.stripecli` file
at the root of each project declaring the test api key for the appropriate Stripe account.

For example `./.stripecli`:

    key = sk_test_abcdef123456

or, if you'd rather:

    default = test
    [test]
      key = sk_test_abcdef123456
    [live]
      key = sk_live_ghijkl789101

If you choose to go this route, make sure to add `.stripecli` to your `.gitignore` files.

### Date/Time

By default, Date/Time stamps are converted automatically to your local machine time. No more Epoch/Unix timestamp garbage!

If you'd prefer to have time Date/Time stamps converted to UTC time, set the config option `dates` or `-d` to `utc`. You can also set it to `unix` to see the original Unix timestamp passed from the API. By default, it uses `local`.

### Dollars vs. Cents

By default stripe-cli expects currency amounts to be specified in **dollars**. This behavior maybe unexpected to veteran Stripe users since the raw API expects **cents**.

To change the expected currency units from **dollars** to **cents**, set the config option `dollar_amounts` to `false` in your `.stripecli` file

    dollar_amounts = false

or

    [test]
      dollar_amounts = false

If not set, this option defaults to **true** meaning that `amounts` should be in **dollars**

If you need to adjust this setting temporarily, there are global flags which maybe passed to any command

    $ stripe charge create --no-dollar-amounts
    Amount In Cents: __

    $ stripe charge create --dollar-amounts
    Amount In Dollars: __

### Cleaner Output

It is common to have Stripe objects with many unused attributes.  All of these nil-valued attributes can sometimes distract from the output you really care about.

In these cases, you can use the `--strip-nils` global option to clean up output significantly.

This option is also congifurable in your `.stripecli` file by setting `strip_nils = true`



## General Features & Flexibility

Any parameters accepted by the [stripe api](https://stripe.com/docs/api) are acceptable options to pass into commands, including metadata and the `expand` parameter.

    $ stripe charges create  --amount=9.98  --description=a\ must\ have  --number=4242424242424242  --cvc=123  --exp-month=10  --exp-year=2020

or

    $ stripe charges create  --amount=16.72  --token=tok_abc123  --metadata=foo:bar meta:baz --expand=balance_transaction

or

    $ stripe charges create  --amount=1  --customer=cus_def456  --no-capture

### Interactive Menus

Passing NO (or partial) arguments to any operation, will trigger an interactive menu

    $ stripe charge create
    Amount In Dollars: __

or

    $ stripe charge create  --amount=99
    Name on Card: __

or

    $ stripe token create card --card=number:4242424242424242 name:Uther\ Pendragon cvc:911 exp-month:02
    Expiration Year: __

### cursor-based pagination

for all `list` operations

    Options:
      [--starting-after=OBJECT_ID]  # The ID of the last object in the previous paged result set.
      [--ending-before=OBJECT_ID]   # The ID of the first object in the previous paged result set, when paging backwards through the list.
      [--limit=LIMIT]               # a limit on the number of resources returned, between 1 and 100


Though Stripe advocates using cursor-based pagination, offset-based pagination is still supported.

e.g. fetching a second page

    stripe events list --count=10 --offset=10

### Exception Recovery

Api errors are rescued and their messages displayed for you to read.  No more `barfing` to `stdout`

#### Transfer Tip:

You can pass the `--balance` flag into `transfer create` to automatically set transfer `amount` equal to your currently available balance.

example:

    $ stripe transfer create --balance --recipient=self


#### Workflow Tip:

Stripe-CLI now tweeks the user-agent header sent with every request.

This adds context to request data as its viewed using the Stripe Dashboard.

It helps in differentiating requests made by application code from those made using the Stripe-CLI gem, which can be helpful, for example when trying to find the source of a phantom API request.

Here is an example of what this looks like in the Stripe Dashboard...

## Road Map

1. `update` command operations
1. support for `disputes` & dispute handling
1. support creating/updating config file through cli
1. plug-able output formating for use in scripts and such
1. request a feature you would like via the issue tracker
