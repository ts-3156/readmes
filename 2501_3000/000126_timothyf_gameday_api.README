Gameday API

The Gameday API allows you to fetch live statistical data from MLB.com servers.  This is the same data that is used by the
Gameday application available on MLB.com.  Another project on GitHub uses the Gameday API to create an application
that allows users to view linescore, boxscore, and play-by-play data for any selected game.  That project is called
Baseball Tracker.
