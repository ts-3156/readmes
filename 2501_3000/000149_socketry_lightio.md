LightIO provides green thread to ruby. Like Golang's goroutine, or Crystal's fiber. In LightIO it is called beam.

Example:

``` ruby
require 'lightio'

start = Time.now

beams = 1000.times.map do
  # LightIO::Beam is green-thread, use it instead Thread
  LightIO::Beam.new do
    # do some io operations in beam
    LightIO.sleep(1)
  end
end

beams.each(&:join)
seconds = Time.now - start
puts "1000 beams take #{seconds - 1} seconds to create"

```


LightIO ship ruby stdlib compatible library under `LightIO` or `LightIO::Library` namespace,
these libraries provide the ability to schedule LightIO beams when IO operations occur.


LightIO also provide a monkey patch, it replaces ruby `Thread` with `LightIO::Thread`, and also replaces `IO` related classes.

Example:

``` ruby
require 'lightio'
# apply monkey patch at beginning
LightIO::Monkey.patch_all!

require 'net/http'

host = 'github.com'
port = 443

start = Time.now

10.times.map do
  Thread.new do
    Net::HTTP.start(host, port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
      res = http.request_get('/ping')
      p res.code
    end
  end
end.each(&:join)

puts "#{Time.now - start} seconds"

```

See [Examples](/examples) for detail.

### You Should Know

In fact ruby core team already plan to implement `Thread::Green` in core language, see https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13618

It means if ruby implemented `Thread::Green`, this library has no reason to exist.
But as a crazy userland implemented green thread library, it bring lots of fun to me, so I will continue to maintain it, and welcome to use.


See [Wiki](https://github.com/jjyr/lightio/wiki) and [Roadmap](https://github.com/jjyr/lightio/wiki/Current-status-and-roadmap) to get more information.

LightIO is build upon [nio4r](https://github.com/socketry/nio4r). Get heavily inspired by [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/), [async-io](https://github.com/socketry/async-io).
