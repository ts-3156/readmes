Venice is a simple gem for verifying Apple In-App Purchase receipts, and retrieving the information associated with receipt data.

There are two reasons why you should verify in-app purchase receipts on the server: First, it allows you to keep your own records of past purchases, which is useful for up-to-the-minute metrics and historical analysis. Second, server-side verification over SSL is the most reliable way to determine the authenticity of purchasing records.

See Apple's [Receipt Validation Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Introduction.html) for additional information.

> Venice is named for [Venice, Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Italy)â€”or more specifically, Shakespeare's [_The Merchant of Venice_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice).
> It's part of a series of world-class command-line utilities for iOS development, which includes [Cupertino](https://github.com/mattt/cupertino) (Apple Dev Center management), [Shenzhen](https://github.com/mattt/shenzhen) (Building & Distribution), [Houston](https://github.com/mattt/houston) (Push Notifications), [Dubai](https://github.com/mattt/dubai) (Passbook pass generation), and [Nashville](https://github.com/nomad/nashville) (iTunes Store API).

## Installation

    $ gem install venice

## Usage

### Basic

```ruby
require 'venice'

data = '(Base64-Encoded Receipt Data)'
if receipt = Venice::Receipt.verify(data)
  p receipt.to_h

  # You can refer an original JSON response via a Receipt instance.
  case receipt.original_json_response['status'].to_i
    when 0     then foo
    when 21006 then bar
  end
end
```

### For Auto-Renewable

```ruby
require 'venice'

data = '(Base64-Encoded Receipt Data)'

# You must pass shared secret when verification on Auto-Renewable
opts = { shared_secret: 'your key' }

if receipt = Venice::Receipt.verify(data, opts)
  # Renewed receipts are added into `latest_receipt_info` array.
  p receipt.latest_receipt_info.map(&:expires_at)
  # => [2016-05-19 20:35:59 +0000, 2016-06-18 20:35:59 +0000, 2016-07-18 20:35:59 +0000]
end
```

## Command Line Interface

Venice also comes with the `iap` binary, which provides a convenient way to verify receipts from the command line.


    $ iap verify /path/to/receipt
