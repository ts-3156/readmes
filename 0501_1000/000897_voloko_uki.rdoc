= Goals for 0.4
* Keep core to bare minimum. Should be under 10KB gziped..
* Keep core and common view pack under 30KB gziped.
* Use css instead of js based themes.
* Data Model and Bindings in the core.
* Use native browser layout instead of rect() + layout()
* CommonJS require() instead of homegrown include()
* Use serverside/clientside js together
* `npm install uki-pack` should work on client side without any extra configuration
* Docs
* Unit tests for core
* Perf tests

= Browser constrains
* IE7+, FF3+, Safari/Chrome latest-1, Opera 10+. Yes, no IE6 any more
