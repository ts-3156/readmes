## Status

We're working on a new foundation for dry-validation, called dry-schema. You can see progress in [this PR](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-schema/pull/3). This will result in a partial rewrite for 1.0.0 version. Currently known bugs/issues will be addressed in 1.0.0, **not in 0.x** due to lack of time. More info about 1.0.0 plans can be found [in this thread](https://discourse.dry-rb.org/t/plans-for-dry-validation-dry-schema-a-new-gem/215/3).
