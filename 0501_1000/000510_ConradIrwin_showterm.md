=============

It's showtime for your terminal!

Showterm lets your record a terminal session exactly as you experience it, right down to
the syntax highlighting.

Installation instructions (`gem install showterm`) and usage instructions (`showterm program`) are available in the [showterm](https://showterm.herokuapp.com/b6803679cb1c9fbcf667cb7cfe8f605e3ce1fe03). :)

(yes, this is me using showterm inside showterm; it's like inception, but with more
syntax highlighting)

Configuration
=============

If you'd like to run your own showterm server, you can
`export SHOWTERM_SERVER=http://showterm.myorg.local/` to configure your showterm
client to talk to it.

TODO
====

* Allow embedders to chose colourschemes (at least light vs. dark background).

Bugs
====

Showterm doesn't preserve enough context for `rvm` to work correctly. This can cause some ruby programs (e.g. capistrano) to crash when used inside a showterm. To fix this run: `rvm use` before running any ruby programs:

```
[~/repo/www] > showterm
Showterm recording. (Exit shell when done.)
[~/repo/www] >  rvm use
Using /Users/jasghar/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p286
[~/repo/www] > cap deploy
...
```

This would not have been doable without the excellent terminal emulator I borrowed from Christopher Jeffrey's incredible [tty.js](https://github.com/chjj/tty.js).

For terminal recording on a mac, this gem bundles Satoru Takabayashi's awesome [`ttyrec`](http://0xcc.net/ttyrec) program.
