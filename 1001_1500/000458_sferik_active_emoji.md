# ActiveEmoji

A collection of emoji aliases for core Ruby methods. Makes Ruby code easier to
read and write, especially for children and people who don't know English.

This project is named with the goal of eventually being merged into Ruby on
Rails. [Stranger things have happened.][forty_two]

With these aliases, you can write your Ruby code like this:

Please open a pull request if you have ideas for more aliases. The only rule is
that commit messages must be written in emoji.
